## Project Overview

This project was created by Michael De Sousa in the fall of 2019.

A food scale is a common kitchen device that allows a user to weigh their food portions. The user can place their food on the scale and read its weight in a variety of different unit types. My project takes this concept and builds upon it by adding a barcode scanner, food database, and WiFi functionality. 

The scale uses a barcode scanner to look up foods in an SQLite database. Then, it calculates and displays nutritional values (calories, carbs, fats, etc.) in real-time based on the portion currently on the scale. Finally, the user can press a button on the scale to upload these nutritional values to an online spreadsheet/food diary. This helps automate calorie counting to make it an easier/faster process.
